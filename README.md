# figure-8-machine-learning
This should provide a solution for the udacity data science nano-degree project. The project consists of messaging data for desasters from Figure-eight. 


## 1. Installations
You need to have the following dependencies installed with pip3:
- jupyter notebook
- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn



## 2. Project Motivation
The underlying data set is a set of emergency text messages. In case of major catastrophic events, incidents are reported by thousands of people. In order to distinguish already known incidents and information from newly incoming relevant news, we use a machine learning pipeline. 
First we clean the data set in an ETL pipeline and afterwards we use the pipeline to train a model that is able to decide weather newly incoming messages provide relevant information.

## 3. File Descriptions
- categories.csv the categories that a message belongs to.
- messages.csv - the disaster messages. 


## 4. How to Interact with your project


## 5. Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.
MIT Licensing - special thanks to Udacity and Figure-Eight for providing the data set.
